  <!--Quotes-->
  <div class="quotes">  
    <div class="quote">All I thought about when I wrote my stories was, “I hope that these comic books would sell so I can keep my job and continue to pay the rent.” Never in a million years could I have imagined that it would turn into what it has evolved into nowadays. Never. - Stan Lee</div>
  
    <div class="quote">I’ve been very lucky. All I wanted was to pay the rent. Then these characters took off and suddenly there were Hulk coffee mugs and Iron Man lunchboxes and The Avengers sweatshirts everywhere. Money’s okay, but what I really like is working. - Stan Lee</div>
      
    <div class="quote">I never thought that Spider-Man would become the world wide icon that he is. I just hoped the books would sell and I’d keep my job. - Stan Lee</div>
    
    <div class="quote">When you work with people whom you like and you admire because they’re so good at what they do, it doesn’t feel like work. It’s like you’re playing. - Stan Lee</div>
      
    <div class="quote">If you are interested in what you do, that keeps you going! - Stan Lee</div>
    
    <div class="quote">There’s never a time when I’m not working. I don’t take vacations. - Stan Lee</div>
    
    <div class="quote">I don’t really see a need to retire as long as I am having fun. - Stan Lee</div>
    
    <div class="quote">I’m very proud of being a hack. It’s why I’ve lived as long as I have, I think. - Stan Lee</div>
    
    </div><!--end of class quotes-->
    
      <div class="quote" id="end-quote">I used to be embarrassed because I was just a comic-book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers. And then I began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people’s lives. Without it they might go off the deep end. I feel that if you’re able to entertain people, you’re doing a good thing. - Stan Lee</div>
